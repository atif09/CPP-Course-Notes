Logical operators perform operations on boolean valuesor expressions that result in boolean values

  '(expr1) && (expr2)' checks whether BOTH are true
  '(expr1) || (expr2)' checks whether EITHER one is true
  ' !(expr) ' returns the OPPOSITE of the result of 'expr'


The operators are called AND, OR, NOT respectively
