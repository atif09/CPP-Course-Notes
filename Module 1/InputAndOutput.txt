Input in C++
To input a value we use the cin operator as follows: 
	
	cinn >> value;

To input multiple values in the same line: 

	cin >> value1 >> value2 >> value3;

NOTE: Each input value must be separated by space or a new line

—----------------------

Output in C++
To output a value, we use the cout operator as follows: 

	cout << value;

To output multiple values in the same line;

	cout << value1 << value2 << value3;

NOTE: To start printing in a new line: endl or ‘ \n ’
