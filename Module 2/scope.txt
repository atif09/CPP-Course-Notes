A scope is a region of the program

Every pair of curly braces creates a new scope

The variables inside the scope cannot be used outside the scope, 

But the variables outside the scope can be used inside

void outerFunction() { //Outer Scope
  int outerVar = 10;  // Variable in outer scope

  { // New inner scope created by curly braces
    int innerVar = 20; //Variable in inner scope
    cout << 'Outer variable inside inner scope: ' << outerVar << endl;
    cout << 'Inner variable inside inner scope: ' << innerVar << endl;

  } 
  //cout << innerVar, will result in a Compilation Error
}
