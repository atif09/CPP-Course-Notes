Loops are used to repeat a block of code until one condition is satisfied


An iteration in loop is defined as one time the loop gets executed. For example, 3rd iteration is the 3rd time the loop is run

'break' statement exits the current/innermost loop when executed.

'continue' statement skips to the next iteration of the current/innermost loop when executed.
